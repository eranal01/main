Lab 9

1) This git repository is used as a space for storing and sharing code. It allows you to view code that I have pushed to Git. I work on things remotely and then push them to the repo so we can both view them. If you wanted to edit or add things to my code you could and we would have one source to work from. 

2) My favorite assignment was the second assignment. It was my first introduction to APIs and how to read their documentation. For me, reading and understanding documentation is one of the most important things I will take from this course as I do not plan to code much in the future, but may be working with programmers. Also, this assignment was challenging, but at the appropraite level where I was able to work and struggle through it with help and accomplish something that basically worked! That is always rewarding.

3) I have grown a lot since Day 1. A lot of the web and web programming was a mystery to me. I knew html was a thing and that was about it. Now I can work through a request/response diagram in my sleep!! My understanding of client and server communication, the network that is the internet, and javascript have all developed becuase of this class.

4) I learned a lot of things in this class and I can narrow it down to 2 as the most important.
	1. I suck at asking for help.
			I should have asked for help early on during assignment 3. I was understanding the material in class but not translating it into progress on assingment 3. I got busy and then I felt I was too far behind to go in to office hours. This is when I get myself in to trouble. I felt behind and so I didn't ask for help (so counterintuitive!!!!). Identifing a problem is the first step to solving it, so I am working on ways to imrpove this.

	2. Never trust user input.
			As a human factors student we spend a lot of time thinking about users. Typically we assume users mess up because we designed things poorly (which usually is true). We don't often think about users being malicious, however. This expanded my thought process and design process. It got me thinking, is it possible to nudge people with malicious intentions away from those intentions through design? We try to stop them with security, but we we add an additional psychological layer before that? Seems difficult, but seems worth thinking about.

5) I would like to delve into security more as I discussed above. I also think reposnive design with html, css, javascript, jquery things are interesting. I didn't do much with animation but you can greatly improve a user experience and communicate lots with some simple animation.

Thanks for a great year!
