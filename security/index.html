<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>I have been tasked with finding as many security and privacy vulnerabilities in Ming Chow’s implementation of the 2048 game server (Comp 20’s Assignment 3). This document will describe the vulnerabilities that were found and offer potential resolutions to the vulnerabilities.</p>
<h1>Methodology</h1>
<p>To find the vulnerabilities in Ming’s implementation of the server, I used multiple techniques. To begin, I used curl to send data to the server through the  “https://gameserver2048.herokuapp.com/submit”  url. This allowed me to insert potentially malicious user input into the system and to attempt to overload the system with excess data. I also manipulated the query strings in the address bar with the url “https://gameserver2048.herokuapp.com/scores.json”. </p>
<p>I inspected the source code Ming provided on Piazza. This allowed me to investigate potential vulnerabilities in the system and understand if there were any protections already in place to prevent some of those vulnerabilities.
</p>
<h1>Abstract of Findings</h1>
<p>I found three major security and privacy issues in Ming Chow’s implementation of the 2048 game server. First, user input is trusted. There are no limits to what the user can input when asked for their username after a game ends. Because of this, users can enter malicious javascript using “script” tags. The javascript can be used to change the page in any way a hacker desires, including adding dangerous content to a page or redirecting the page to any url.</p>
<p>The second major issue I identified was in the protection of data. As a feature of the program, users are able to search for scores by username. Dangerously, user input is trusted. Because of this, malicious users can trick the search functionality to reveal data for all users instead of one specific user. Malicious users are able to change the search from “find all usernames matching name X” to “find all usernames NOT matching X” with a simple addition of database search logic. This could reveal the data of all users which is a major privacy breach. </p>
<p>The third security issue I determined is in how much data the server can hold. All user input data is stored in a database. Databases have a finite amount of data that can be held. This is something that hackers can prey on. Malicious users can write a script to continuously send data to the server to fill up the database. Eventually, the database will fill up and not be able to take any more input. When this happens, the application will break. Even before the application breaks, performance will be slowed immensely by the large amount of data that must be loaded. This is a security issue that can be exploited. </p>
<h1>Issues Found</h1>
<h2>Issue 1: Cross Site Scripting (XSS)</h2> <h3>Location:</h3><p>Entering username on frontend</p><h3>Severity:</h3><p>High severity. Hacker has complete control over action of the page. Can prevent anyone from using page by redirecting all users to another page. </p><h3>Description of issue:</h3><p>The code takes input provided by the user in the username field and displays it with the user’s score. No parsing or limitation of characters protects the program. Because of this, if a user were to write javascript within '<'script'>' and '<'/script'>', the code reads through it and runs the javascript as it attempts to write the username and score to the screen. This gives a hacker complete control over the behavior of the page</p><h3>Proof of Vulnerability:</h3><p>PIC</p><h3>Resolution:</h3><p>This issue can be resolved with two simple fixes. The first is to limit the character entry of the username field to 15 characters (or any number that doesn’t allow for two complete script tags). The other is to strip the username of all special symbols (anything that isn’t a letter). This way “<” and “>” symbols could not longer be used to denote a script tag. The combination of both resolutions would prevent cross site scripting in the username entry.</p>
