1) What aspects of the work have been implemented properly?

Although my solution works, I am not sure it is the best solution. I first attempted to manipulate the sprite image by using the technique found at this link: "How to use CSS sprites" (varvy.com)

It did not work when I tried to follow this method. I thought this method was changing the size of the image and the origin point of where this size was measured from. I was able to change the size, but I was not able to start this measurement at any other point than the top left corner of the image.

I attempted my next solution which I found here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/23220895
This solution involved hiding portions of the overflow image will adjusting the margins to shift the image to the left (i.e. made the margins negative)

This solution worked, but I do think there is a better, cleaner solution that the one I found.

2) I did not colloborate with anyone :( Unfortunately this was a super busy week and I didn't get a chance to go to office hours to disucss with a TA or to disucss with any other students. 

3) I spent approximalty 3 hours on this assignment. Most of that time was spent on a small detail, querrying the min and max SCREEN width versus just the width!!!
