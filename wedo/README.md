Lab We Do
October 9,2018



1) Everything in this assignment has been implemnted correctly and fully.

2) I did not collaborate or discuss this assignment with anyone else. I did consult the following sources:

	https://github.com/tuftsdev/WebProgramming/blob/gh-pages/examples/doublerainbow/index.html
	https://www.w3schools.com/tags/av_prop_currenttime.asp
	https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener
	https://www.w3schools.com/js/tryit.asp?filename=tryjs_addeventlistener_displaydate

These sources helped with the addEventListener function.

3) I spent about 3 hours on this lab.
