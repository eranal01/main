Assignment 2

So not my best :(  but the following was implemented properly:

1) MBTA station marked on map
2) Each station has an icon
3) Polyline is rendered
4) Determine location, center to this spot once determined
5) Not closest MBTA station in infowindow
6) Polyline connecting closest station to current location
7) MBTA station have info window
8) Data parsed from JSON API provided

Not implemented properly:
1) The info window for each station does not show the parsed data
2) I didn't commit nearly enough. I am still not used to doing it- but I must get better!!

I did not collaborate with anyone on this assignment (perhaps this is why I wasn;t able to figure out the last piece!! Must change this for next assignment)

I spent approximitly 20 hours on this assignment. I did two chunks of work, 1 when it was first assigned because I knew I ahd a busy week or so ahead and then the last couple days after my busy period ended.

This was a fun assignment. I'm disapointed I didn't have the time to coehsively work on the project.
